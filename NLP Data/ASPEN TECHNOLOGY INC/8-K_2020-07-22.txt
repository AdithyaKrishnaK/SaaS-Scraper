The purpose of the fiscal 2021 plan is to motivate and reward performance for achieving our financial and operational objectives for fiscal 2021.  Payments under the plan are based upon the achievement of predetermined annual corporate financial metrics consisting of target amounts for growth in annual spend and free cash flow. Each of the target amounts is established by the board and is weighted at 60% and 40%, respectively, for purposes of determining each participant’s bonus.  In order for any bonus to be payable with respect to a target amount, we must achieve at least 70% of the target amount.Performance against the corporate financial metrics will be evaluated mid-year and at year-end. Each participant has the potential for a mid-year payment, in an amount not to exceed 25% of the annual bonus target, based on performance against mid-year target amounts. The year-end payment is based on annual performance against the annual performance targets, less any payment received at mid-year.  If mid-year payments are made and we underachieve the metrics for the full year, each participant shall refund the amount by which his mid-year payment exceeds the total amount he is entitled to receive for the year. Under the plan, the compensation committee may make a discretionary award to a participant in such amount as the compensation committee determines to be appropriate and in the best interests of our company.
