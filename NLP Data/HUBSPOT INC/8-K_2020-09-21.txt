Item 5.03.
 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  On September 15, 2020, based on the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors (the “Board”) of HubSpot, Inc. (the “Company”), the Board approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated bylaws (the “Amendment”), effective immediately. The Amendment (1) designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive jurisdiction for any state law claims for (i) any derivative action, (ii) any claim of breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) any claim against a current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder, and (iv) any action against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (2) designates the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive jurisdiction for any litigation arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as the Company’s headquarters are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In addition, the Amendment provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Company’s capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. The Board approved the Amendment in order to reduce any potential expenses that the Company may incur in connection with any of the specified types of actions or proceedings if the Company was required to defend any such potential actions or proceedings in multiple jurisdictions and in parallel proceedings in federal and state courts simultaneously.  A copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment.
