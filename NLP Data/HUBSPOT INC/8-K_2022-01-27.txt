Item 8.01.  Other Events.
On January 26, 2022, the Board of Directors of HubSpot, Inc. (the “Company”) approved an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the HubSpot, Inc. 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) to eliminate, on a prospective basis, the “evergreen” provision of the Plan, which provided for automatic annual cumulative increases in the number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), available for issuance under the Plan.  The final “evergreen” increase under the Plan was effective as of January 1, 2022 (the “2022 Evergreen Increase”), and the Company expects to file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 on or about February 15, 2022 with respect to the 2022 Evergreen Increase.  As a result of the Amendment, no additional “evergreen” increases will occur under the Plan after the 2022 Evergreen Increase.  As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, 10,899,744 shares of Common Stock were available for future issuance under the Plan, as amended, after giving effect to the 2022 Evergreen Increase.
A copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment.
