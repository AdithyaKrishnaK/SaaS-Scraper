BASIS OF PRESENTATIONPegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “the Company”) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.In the opinion of management, the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as its audited financial statements, and these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year 2020.2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFinancial instrumentsIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of “other-than-temporary” impairments. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.3.

Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period. The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2020 was primarily due to new billings in advance of revenue recognition, partially offset by revenue recognized during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2019.4.

DEBTConvertible senior notes and capped callsConvertible senior notesIn February 2020, the Company issued Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") with an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, due March 1, 2025, in a private placement to certain initial purchasers in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in transactions not involving any public offering, for resale by the initial purchasers to persons whom the initial purchasers believe are qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act. This included $75 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes that the Company issued resulting from initial purchasers fully exercising their option to purchase additional Notes. There are no required principal payments prior to the maturity of the Notes. The Notes will accrue interest at an annual rate of 0.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2020. The proceeds of the issuance were used for the Capped Call Transactions (described below), working capital, and other general corporate purposes.Total net proceeds from the Notes and Capped Call Transactions:(in thousands)AmountPrincipal$600,000  Less: issuance costs(14,527) Less: Capped Call Transactions(51,900) $533,573  Beginning on September 1, 2024, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election. Before September 1, 2024, noteholders may convert their Notes in the following circumstances:•During any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds one hundred and thirty percent (130%) of the conversion price for each of at least twenty (20) trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the thirty (30) consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.•During the five (5) consecutive business days immediately after any five (5) consecutive trading day period, (the “Measurement Period”) if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than ninety eight percent (98%) of the product of the last reported sale price per share of common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day.•Upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions, or if the Company calls all or any Notes for redemption, then the noteholder of any Note may convert such Note at any time before the close of business on the business day immediately before the related redemption date (or, if the Company fails to pay the redemption price due on such redemption date in full, at any time until the Company pays such redemption price in full).As of March 31, 2020, no Notes were eligible for conversion at the election of the noteholder. The initial conversion rate is 7.4045 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $135.05 per share of common stock. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election, based on the applicable conversion rate. The conversion rate will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events including spin offs, tender offers, exchange offers and certain stockholder distributions.On or after March 1, 2023 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a redemption notice.10PEGASYSTEMS INC.NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)If certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” (as described below) occur at any time, each noteholder will have the right, at such noteholder’s option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such noteholder’s Notes, or any portion of the principal thereof that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. A fundamental change relates to events such as mergers, changes in control of the Company, liquidation/dissolution of the Company, or the delisting of the Company’s common stock.In accounting for the transaction, the Notes have been separated into liability and equity components.•The initial carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated conversion feature. •The equity component was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the Notes over the initial carrying amount of the liability component, the debt discount, is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Notes.The Company incurred issuance costs of $14.5 million related to the Notes, which were allocated between liability and equity components of the Notes proportionate to the initial carry amount of the liability and equity components.•Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are netted against the principal balance of the Notes and are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the Notes. •Issuance costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity component in additional paid-in capital and are not amortized.Net carrying amount of the liability component:(in thousands)March 31, 2020Principal$600,000  Unamortized debt discount(82,624) Unamortized issuance costs(12,268) $505,108  Net carrying amount of the equity component, included in additional paid in capital:(in thousands)March 31, 2020Conversion options (1)$61,604  (1) Net of issuance costs and taxes.Interest expense related to the Notes:Three Months EndedMarch 31,(in thousands)2020Contractual interest expense (0.75% coupon)$450  Amortization of debt discount (1)1,497  Amortization of issuance cost (1)222  $2,169  (1) Amortized based upon an effective interest rate of 4.31%.Future payments of principal and contractual interest:March 31, 2020(in thousands)PrincipalInterestTotal2020$—  $2,338  $2,338  2021—  4,500  4,500  2022—  4,500  4,500  2023—  4,500  4,500  2024—  4,500  4,500  2025600,000  1,488  601,488  $600,000  $21,826  $621,826  PEGASYSTEMS INC.NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Capped call transactionsIn February 2020, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (“Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions cover approximately 4.4 million shares (representing the number of shares for which the Notes are initially convertible) of the Company’s common stock and are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially $196.44. The Capped Call Transactions are classified as “other long-term assets” and re-measured to fair value at the end of each reporting period, resulting in a non-operating gain or loss.Change in value of Capped Call Transactions:(in thousands)Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2020Value at issuance$51,900  Fair value adjustment(18,592) Balance as of March 31,$33,308  Credit FacilityIn November 2019, and as amended in February 2020, the Company entered into a five-year $100 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”). The Company may use borrowings to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Subject to specific circumstances, the Credit Facility allows the Company to increase the aggregate commitment up to $200 million.The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, those relating to additional indebtedness, liens, asset divestitures, and affiliate transactions. The Company is also required to comply with financial covenants that consist of a maximum net consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5 (with a step-up in the event of certain acquisitions) and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.5. The commitments expire on November 4, 2024, and any outstanding loans will be payable on such date.As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basisThe Company records its cash equivalents, Capped Call Transactions, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for classifying the fair value measurements, a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies the fair value measurements based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, was established as follows: •Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and •Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.The Company’s cash equivalents are composed of money market funds which are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Capped Call Transactions at the end of each reporting period is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. These valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.

The fair value of the debt component was determined based on a discounted cash flow model. The discount rate used reflected both the time value of money and credit risk inherent in the Notes. The carrying value of the Notes will be accreted, over the remaining term to maturity, to their principal value of $600 million. The fair value of the Notes (inclusive of the conversion feature which is embedded in the Notes) was approximately $533 million as of March 31, 2020. The fair value was determined based on the quoted price of the Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period and has been classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

(LOSS) PER SHAREBasic (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, RSUs, and the impact of the conversion spread of the Company’s convertible senior notes.

As a result, only the amount by which the conversion value exceeds the aggregated principal amount of the Notes is included in the diluted earnings per share computation under the treasury stock method. The conversion spread has a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period of time exceeds the initial conversion price of $135.05 per share for the Notes. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into Capped Call Transactions, which were not included in calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (2) In periods of loss, all dilutive securities are excluded as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.(3) Certain outstanding stock options and RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive in the period presented.

These risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements are described further in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and other filings we make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).Except as required by applicable law, we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements whether as the result of new information, future events, or otherwise.BUSINESS OVERVIEWWe develop, market, license, host, and support enterprise software applications that help organizations transform the way they engage with their customers and process work across their enterprise. We also license our low-code Pega Platform™ for rapid application development to clients that wish to build and extend their business applications. Our cloud-architected portfolio of customer engagement and digital process automation applications leverages artificial intelligence (“AI”), case management, and robotic automation technology, built on our unified low-code Pega Platform, empowering businesses to quickly design, extend, and scale their enterprise applications to meet strategic business needs.Our target clients are Global 3000 organizations and government agencies that require applications to differentiate themselves in the markets they serve. Our applications achieve and facilitate differentiation by increasing business agility, driving growth, improving productivity, attracting and retaining customers, and reducing risk. We deliver applications tailored to our clients’ specific industry needs.COVID-19The impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our clients and our sales cycles, and impact on our partners or employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As of March 31, 2020, COVID-19 has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our shift towards subscription-based revenue streams, the industry mix of our clients, our product mix, the fact that many of our clients are well-known and of large size, and the critical nature of our products to our clients may reduce the impact of COVID-19 on our business compared to other businesses or may delay the effect, if any, of COVID-19 on our results of operations until future periods. However, it is not possible to estimate the ultimate impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, and such an impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted certain of our client events to virtual-only experiences, and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional client, employee, or industry events in the future. See “Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)” under Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.17Performance metricsWe utilize several performance metrics in analyzing and assessing our overall performance, making operating decisions, and forecasting and planning for future periods including:Annual contract value (“ACV”) | +21% since March 31, 2019•ACV represents the annualized value of our active contracts as of the measurement date. ACV for term license and cloud contracts is calculated by dividing the total value of the contract by the duration of the contract in years. ACV for maintenance is calculated as maintenance revenue for the quarter then ended multiplied by four. Client cloud ACV is composed of maintenance ACV and ACV from term license contracts. We believe the presentation of ACV on a constant currency basis enhances the understanding of our results and evaluation of our performance in comparison to prior periods, as it provides visibility into the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which are outside of our control. All periods shown reflect foreign currency exchange rates as of March 31, 2020.Remaining performance obligations (“Backlog”) | +19% since March 31, 2019•Backlog represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and non-cancellable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Cloud revenue | +57% since March 31, 2019•Cloud revenue is revenue as reported under US GAAP for cloud contracts.18CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.”) and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future given available information.For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, we encourage you to read the discussion contained in the following locations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019:•“Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgments” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”; and •Note 2. “Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 other than those listed below.Capped Call TransactionsIn February 2020, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (“Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions cover approximately 4.4 million shares (representing the number of shares for which the Notes are initially convertible) of our common stock and are generally expected to reduce potential dilution of our common stock upon any conversion of Notes. The fair value of the Capped Call Transactions at the end of each reporting period is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. These valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. Management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. We consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels. The Capped Call Transactions are classified as “other long-term assets” and re-measured to fair value at the end of each reporting period, resulting in a non-operating gain or loss. See "6. Debt" and “7. Fair Value Measurements”  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information.19RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenueOur license revenue is derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform. Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted Pega Platform and software applications. We expect our revenue mix to continue to shift in favor of our subscription offerings, particularly cloud arrangements, which could result in slower total revenue growth in the near term.

This fluctuation may continue in future periods, depending on our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards, the timing of the vestings of RSU awards, the exercise behavior of our stock option holders, and the total value of future grants of stock-based compensation awards.During the three months ended March 31, 2020, our effective income tax rate benefit increased primarily due to the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and a carry back claim benefit as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), partially offset by Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”).21LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThree Months EndedMarch 31, (in thousands)20202019Cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$(18,323) $22,703  Investing activities(12,562) (1,466) Financing activities502,174  (25,587) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(1,510) 295  Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$469,779  $(4,055) (in thousands)March 31, 2020December 31, 2019Held by U.S. entities$493,629  $23,437  Held by foreign entities44,513  44,926  Total cash and cash equivalents$538,142  $68,363  We believe that our current cash, cash flow from operations, and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations and quarterly cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, and the investments required to meet the possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business, we may seek to finance our operations from available funds or additional external financing.If it became necessary to repatriate foreign funds, we may be required to pay U.S. and foreign taxes upon repatriation. Due to the complexity of income tax laws and regulations, and the effects of the Tax Reform Act, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of taxes we would have to pay.Cash (used in) provided by operating activitiesAs client preferences continue to shift in favor of cloud arrangements, we could continue to experience slower operating cash flow growth, or negative cash flow, in the near term. Cash from cloud and term arrangements is generally collected over an average service period of three years, while cash from perpetual license arrangements is generally collected upfront, shortly after the license rights become effective.The primary driver of the decrease in the three months ended March 31, 2020 was the recent shift in our revenue mix toward cloud arrangements and increased costs as we accelerated investments in our cloud offerings and selling and marketing activities to support future growth.In the three months ended March 31, 2020, COVID-19 did not have a material impact on our cash flows from operations. See “Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)” under Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.Cash (used in) investing activities The change in cash (used in) investing activities was primarily driven by investments in property and equipment at several of our office locations.Cash provided by (used in) financing activitiesIn February 2020, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes (“Notes”) due March 1, 2025, which provided net proceeds as follows:(in thousands)AmountPrincipal$600,000  Less: issuance costs(14,527) Less: Capped Call Transactions(51,900) $533,573  A portion of the proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the Capped Call Transactions with the remainder to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

However, the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offsets our foreign currency exposure. 23A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in the following impact:Three Months EndedMarch 31,20202019(Decrease) increase in revenue (3)%(4)%(Decrease) increase in net income (14)%(6)%Remeasurement riskWe experience fluctuations in transaction gains or losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity. A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the British pound exchange rate in comparison to the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar would result in the following impact:Three Months EndedMarch 31,(in millions)20202019Foreign currency gain (loss) $7  $(4) ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) as of March 31, 2020. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2020.(b) Changes in internal control over financial reportingThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.COVID-19In response to COVID-19, we have undertaken measures to protect our employees, partners, and clients, including encouraging employees to work remotely. These changes have compelled us to modify some of our control procedures. However, those changes have so far not been material.24PART II - OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSWe encourage you to carefully consider the risk factors identified below and in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2020. These risk factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results, and they could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or elsewhere by management from time to time. Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)Epidemic diseases, such as the recent global COVID-19 outbreak, could harm our business and results of operations.The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”), which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public health epidemic poses the risk that we or our employees and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that are requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of IT spending and may adversely affect our clients’ willingness to purchase our solutions, delay prospective clients’ purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their contracts, request concessions including extended payment terms or better pricing, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption.We have undertaken measures to protect our employees, partners, and clients, including by adopting a virtual-only meeting format for our annual PegaWorld conference and by encouraging employees to work remotely. There can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient, however, or that we can implement them without adversely affecting our business operations. We continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available. Precautionary measures that have been adopted, or may be adopted in the future, could negatively affect our client success efforts, sales, and marketing efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, COVID-19 may disrupt the operations of our clients, vendors, and partners for an indefinite period, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows. It is not possible at this time to estimate the ultimate impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Furthermore, due to our shift to a renewable model, the effect of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to predict accurately, including:•the duration and scope of the pandemic;•governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity;•the actions taken in response to economic disruption; •the impact of business disruptions and reductions in our clients’ business and the resulting impact on their demand for our services and solutions; and•our ability to provide our services and solutions, including as a result of our employees or our clients’ employees working remotely and/or closures of offices and facilities.Risks related to our Convertible Senior NotesWe have a significant amount of debt that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase our borrowing costs, and we may still incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.As of March 31, 2020, we had $600 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”).Our indebtedness may:•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;25•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; •dilute the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon the conversion of the Notes; and•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.Our ability to pay our debt when due or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.In addition, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt to meet future financing needs. We will not be restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.Pursuant to their terms, holders of the Notes may convert their Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of Notes under certain circumstances. Upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion, we will be obligated to make cash payments. In addition, holders of our Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture, dated as of February 24, 2020, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) (the “Indenture”)), at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. Although it is our intention and we currently expect to settle the conversion value of the Notes in cash up to the principal amount and any excess in shares, there is a risk that we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the Indenture requires the repurchase or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. In addition, even if holders of Notes do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.Under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC 470-20), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component is treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record noncash interest expense through the amortization of the excess of the face amount over the carrying amount of the expected life of the Notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s cash coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the trading price of the Notes.In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, is included in the denominator for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.26The capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (“option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. From time to time, the option counterparties that are parties to the capped call transactions or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.Provisions in the indenture for the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to our stockholders.If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes. In addition, if a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture) occurs prior the maturity date, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate of the Notes for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change.Furthermore, the Indenture will prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the Indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to our stockholders.Conversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.The conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of the Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.27ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSIssuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesCommon stock repurchased in the three months ended March 31, 2020 was:(in thousands, except per share amounts)Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) (2)Average Price Paid per Share (1) (2)Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Share Repurchase Program (2)Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased at Period End Under Publicly Announced Share Repurchase Programs (2)January 1, 2020 - January 31, 202033  $82.11  —  $45,484  February 1, 2020 - February 29, 2020181  $97.83  —  $45,484  March 1, 2020 - March 31, 2020299  $79.88  87  $39,484  513  $86.35  87(1) Shares withheld to cover the option exercise price and tax withholding obligations under the net settlement provisions of our stock compensation awards have been included in these amounts.
