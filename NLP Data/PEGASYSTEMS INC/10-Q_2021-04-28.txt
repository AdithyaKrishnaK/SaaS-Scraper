BASIS OF PRESENTATIONPegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “the Company”) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”) for complete financial statements. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.In the opinion of management, the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as its audited financial statements, and these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. All intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation. The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year 2021.NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSConvertible debtIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, “Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The standard eliminates the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature. As a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in stockholders’ equity an embedded conversion feature for such debt. Additionally, the debt discount resulting from the separation of the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the instrument’s life. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. The standard also requires the convertible instruments’ impact on diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) be determined using the if-converted method.The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2021. Upon adoption, the book value of the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes (the “Notes”) increased by $69.5 million to $587.7 million, and retained earnings increased by $9.4 million. The retained earnings adjustment reflects the tax effected difference between the value of the Notes and the embedded conversion feature before adoption and the combined convertible instrument's amortized cost after adoption.See "Note 8. Debt" for additional information.NOTE 3.

DEBTConvertible senior notes and capped callsConvertible senior notesIn February 2020, the Company issued Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") with an aggregate principal of $600 million, due March 1, 2025, in a private placement. No principal payments are required before maturity. The Notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 0.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, beginning on September 1, 2020.Conversion rightsThe conversion rate is 7.4045 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, representing an initial conversion price of $135.05 per share of common stock. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election, based on the applicable conversion rate. The conversion rate will be adjusted upon certain events, including spin-offs, tender offers, exchange offers, and certain stockholder distributions.Beginning on September 1, 2024, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election. Before September 1, 2024, noteholders may convert their Notes in the following circumstances:•During any calendar quarter commencing after June 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.•During the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the “Measurement Period”), if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day.•Upon certain corporate events or distributions or if the Company calls any Notes for redemption, noteholders may convert before the close of business on the business day immediately before the related redemption date (or, if the Company fails to pay the redemption price in full on the redemption date, until the Company pays the redemption price).As of March 31, 2021, the Notes were not eligible for conversion at the noteholders’ election. Repurchase rightsOn or after March 1, 2023 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a redemption notice.If certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” occur, each noteholder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such noteholder’s Notes, or any portion of the principal thereof that is equal to $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. A Fundamental Change relates to mergers, changes in control of the Company, liquidation/dissolution of the Company, or the delisting of the Company’s common stock.Impact of the NotesThe Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2021. The standard eliminates the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature. See "Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements" for additional information.Until January 1, 2021, the Notes were separated into liability and equity components.•The initial carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring a similar debt instrument’s fair value that does not have an associated conversion feature. The excess of the Notes’ principal amount over the initial carrying amount of the liability component, the debt discount, was amortized as interest expense over the Notes’ contractual term.•The equity component was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital and not remeasured. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the book value of the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes (the “Notes”) increased by $69.5 million to $587.7 million, and retained earnings increased by $9.4 million. The retained earnings adjustment reflects the tax effected difference between the value of the Notes and the embedded conversion feature before adoption and the combined convertible instrument's amortized cost after adoption.12PEGASYSTEMS INC.NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Carrying value of the Notes:(in thousands)March 31, 2021December 31, 2020Principal$600,000 $600,000 Unamortized debt discount— (71,222)Unamortized issuance costs(11,582)(10,575)Convertible senior notes, net$588,418 $518,203 Conversion options$— $84,120 Issuance costs— (2,037)Deferred taxes— (20,479)Additional paid-in capital$— $61,604 Interest expense related to the Notes:Three Months EndedMarch 31,(in thousands)20212020Contractual interest expense (0.75% coupon)$1,125 $450 Amortization of debt discount— 1,497 Amortization of issuance costs673 222 $1,798 $2,169 Weighted-average effective interest rate1.2 %4.3 %Future payments of principal and contractual interest:March 31, 2021(in thousands)PrincipalInterestTotal2021$— $2,250 $2,250 2022— 4,500 4,500 2023— 4,500 4,500 2024— 4,500 4,500 2025600,000 1,488 601,488 $600,000 $17,238 $617,238 Capped call transactionsIn February 2020, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (“Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions cover approximately 4.4 million shares (representing the number of shares for which the Notes are initially convertible) of the Company’s common stock. The Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce common stock dilution and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make, other than for principal and interest, upon conversion of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap of $196.44. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including mergers and tender offers.The Capped Call Transactions are accounted for as derivative instruments and do not qualify for the Company’s own equity scope exception in ASC 815 since, in some cases of early settlement, the settlement value of the Capped Call Transactions, calculated in accordance with the governing documents, may not represent a fair value measurement. The Capped Call Transactions are classified as “other long-term assets” and remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period, resulting in a non-operating gain or loss.13PEGASYSTEMS INC.NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)Change in capped call transactions:Three Months EndedMarch 31,(in thousands)20212020January 1,$83,597 $— Issuance— 51,900 Fair value adjustment(19,117)(18,592)March 31,$64,480 $33,308 Credit facilityIn November 2019, and as amended as of February 2020, July 2020, and September 2020, the Company entered into a five-year $100 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”). The Company may use borrowings to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Subject to specific conditions, the Credit Facility allows the Company to increase the aggregate commitment to $200 million. The commitments expire on November 4, 2024, and any outstanding loans will be payable on such date. The Credit Facility, as amended, contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, those relating to additional indebtedness, liens, asset divestitures, and affiliate transactions. The Company is also required to comply with financial covenants, including:•Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended on September 30, 2020 and ending with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 at least $200 million in cash and investments held by Pegasystems Inc.•Beginning with the quarter ended on March 31, 2022 a maximum net consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0 (with a step-up in the event of certain acquisitions) and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0.As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basisThe Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, Capped Call Transactions, and venture investments at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for classifying the fair value measurements, a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies the fair value measurements based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, was established as follows: •Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and •Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and minimize unobservable inputs when determining fair value.The fair value of the Capped Call Transactions at the end of each reporting period is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield. The Company applies judgment when determining expected volatility. The Company considers both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security. The Company’s venture investments are recorded at fair value based on valuation methods, including observable public companies and transaction prices and unobservable inputs, including the volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities the Company holds.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:March 31, 2021December 31, 2020(in thousands)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash equivalents$26,657 $— $— $26,657 $42,339 $14,000 $— $56,339 Marketable securities $— $269,650 $— $269,650 $— $293,269 $— $293,269 Capped Call Transactions (1)$— $64,480 $— $64,480 $— $83,597 $— $83,597 Venture investments (1) (2)$— $— $9,756 $9,756 $— $— $8,345 $8,345 (1) Included in other long-term assets.

(3) The Company’s Capped Call Transactions cover approximately 4.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock (representing the number of shares for which the Notes are initially convertible). The Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce common stock dilution and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make, other than for principal and interest, upon conversion of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap of $196.44. The Capped Call Transactions are excluded in all periods as their effect would be anti-dilutive.(4) Outstanding stock options and RSUs that were anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method in the period were excluded from the computation of diluted (loss) per share.

Our clients are able to make better decisions and get work done using real-time artificial intelligence (“AI”) and intelligent automation on applications built on the low-code, cloud-native Pega Platform™, enabling our clients to streamline service, increase customer lifetime value, and boost efficiency. Our consulting and client success teams, along with our world-class partners, leverage our Pega Express™ methodology and low code to allow clients to design and deploy critical applications quickly and collaboratively.Our target clients are Global 3000 organizations and government agencies that require applications to differentiate themselves in the markets they serve. Our applications achieve and facilitate differentiation by increasing business agility, driving growth, improving productivity, attracting and retaining customers, and reducing risk. We deliver applications tailored to our clients’ specific industry needs.18Cloud TransitionWe are in the process of transitioning our business to sell software primarily through subscription arrangements, particularly Pega Cloud. Until we substantially complete our Cloud Transition, which we anticipate will occur in late 2022 or early 2023, we may experience lower revenue growth and lower operating cash flow growth or negative cash flow. Operating performance and the actual mix of revenue and new arrangements in a given period can fluctuate based on client preferences for our perpetual and subscription offerings. See the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information.Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)As of March 31, 2021, COVID-19 has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. See “Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)” in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information.Performance metricsWe utilize performance metrics to analyze and assess our overall performance, make operating decisions, and forecast and plan for future periods, including:Annual contract value (“ACV”) | Increased 20% since March 31, 2020•ACV, as reported, represents the annualized value of our active contracts as of the measurement date. The contract's total value is divided by its duration in years to calculate ACV for term license and Pega Cloud contracts. Maintenance revenue for the quarter then ended is multiplied by four to calculate ACV for maintenance. Client Cloud ACV is composed of maintenance ACV and term license ACV. ACV is a performance measure that we believe provides useful information to our management and investors, particularly during our Cloud Transition. Reported amounts have not been adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange rate changes contributed 3% to total ACV growth in 2021.19Remaining performance obligations (“Backlog”) | Increased 30% since March 31, 2020•Backlog represents expected future revenue on existing non-cancellable contracts.Year to date Pega Cloud revenue | Increased 56% since the three months ended March 31, 2020•Pega Cloud revenue is revenue under U.S. GAAP for cloud contracts.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared following accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future given the available information.For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, we encourage you to read the discussion in the following locations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020:20•“Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgments” in Item 7; and •Note 2. “Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8.There have been no significant changes other than those disclosed in “Note 2.

Revenue growth has been slower because of this transition. Revenue from Pega Cloud and maintenance arrangements is typically recognized over the contract term.

Other factors impacting our revenue include:•An increasing portion of our term license contracts include multi-year committed maintenance periods instead of annually renewable maintenance periods. Under multi-year committed maintenance arrangements, a larger portion of the total contract value is recognized as maintenance revenue over the contract term rather than as term license revenue upon the effectiveness of the license rights. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, multi-year committed maintenance contributed $3.4 million to maintenance revenue growth and reduced term revenue growth by $5.5 million.•Maintenance renewal rates of higher than 90%.•The decrease in consulting revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in billable travel expenses as a result of COVID-19.

Due to the complexity of income tax laws and regulations, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of taxes we would have to pay.Operating activitiesWe are in the process of transitioning our business to sell software primarily through subscription arrangements, particularly Pega Cloud. This transition has and is expected to continue to impact our billings and timing of cash collections. Pega Cloud, term license, and maintenance arrangements are generally billed and collected over the contract term, while perpetual license arrangements are generally billed and collected upfront when the license rights become effective. As client preferences shift in favor of Pega Cloud arrangements, we could experience slower operating cash flow growth, or negative cash flow, in the near term.The change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to a significant increase in client collections. In February 2021, we agreed to accelerate our exit from our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters to October 1, 2021, in exchange for a one-time payment from our landlord of $18 million, which is expected to be paid in the last quarter of 2021. The accelerated exit from this lease reduced our future lease liabilities by $21.1 million.Investing activitiesThe change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily driven by investments in financial instruments, an acquisition, and a decrease in office space related capital expenditures.Financing activitiesIn February 2020, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due March 1, 2025. In November 2019, and as amended as of February 2020, July 2020, and September 2020, we entered into a five-year $100 million senior secured revolving credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association. As of March 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. See "Note 8. Debt" in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information.23Stock repurchase programChanges in the remaining stock repurchase authority:(in thousands)Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2021December 31, 2020$37,726 Repurchases (1)(9,146)March 31, 2021$28,580 (1) Purchases under this program have been made on the open market.Common stock repurchasesThree Months EndedMarch 31,20212020(in thousands)SharesAmountSharesAmountTax withholdings for net settlement of equity awards197 $25,509 257 $23,011 Stock repurchase program70 9,146 87 6,000 267 $34,655 344 $29,011 During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, instead of receiving cash from the equity holders, we withheld shares with a value of $10.1 million and $15.3 million, respectively, for the exercise price of options.

However, our international sales are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offsets our foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have resulted in:Three Months EndedMarch 31,20212020(Decrease) increase in revenue(4)%(3)%(Decrease) increase in net income20 %(14)%Remeasurement riskWe experience fluctuations in transaction gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity. A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the British pound exchange rate in comparison to the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar would have resulted in the following impact:Three Months EndedMarch 31,(in thousands)20212020Foreign currency gain (loss)$(7,522)$7,190 24ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) as of March 31, 2021. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2021.(b) Changes in internal control over financial reportingThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.25PART II - OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSWe encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
