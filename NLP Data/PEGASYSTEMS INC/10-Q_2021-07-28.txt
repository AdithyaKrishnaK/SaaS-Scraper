BASIS OF PRESENTATIONPegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “the Company”) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”) for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.In the opinion of management, the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as its audited financial statements, and these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. All intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation. The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year 2021.NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSConvertible debtIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06, “Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity” (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The standard eliminates the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature. As a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in stockholders’ equity an embedded conversion feature for such debt. Additionally, the debt discount resulting from separating the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the instrument’s life. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. The standard also requires the convertible instruments’ impact on diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) be determined using the if-converted method.The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2021. Upon adoption, the book value of the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes (the “Notes”) increased by $69.5 million to $587.7 million, and retained earnings increased by $9.4 million. The retained earnings adjustment reflects the tax effected difference between the value of the Notes and the embedded conversion feature before adoption and the combined convertible instrument's amortized cost after adoption.See "Note 8. Debt" for additional information.NOTE 3.

The Notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 0.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, beginning on September 1, 2020.Conversion rightsThe conversion rate is 7.4045 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, representing an initial conversion price of $135.05 per share of common stock. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election, based on the applicable conversion rate. The conversion rate will be adjusted upon certain events, including spin-offs, tender offers, exchange offers, and certain stockholder distributions.Beginning on September 1, 2024, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election. Before September 1, 2024, noteholders may convert their Notes in the following circumstances:•During any calendar quarter commencing after June 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.•During the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the “Measurement Period”), if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day.•Upon certain corporate events or distributions or if the Company calls any Notes for redemption, noteholders may convert before the close of business on the business day immediately before the related redemption date (or, if the Company fails to pay the redemption price in full on the redemption date, until the Company pays the redemption price).As of June 30, 2021, the Notes were not eligible for conversion at the noteholders’ election. Repurchase rightsOn or after March 1, 2023 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a redemption notice.12PEGASYSTEMS INC.NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)If certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” occur, each noteholder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such noteholder’s Notes, or any portion of the principal thereof that is equal to $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. A Fundamental Change relates to mergers, changes in control of the Company, liquidation/dissolution of the Company, or the delisting of the Company’s common stock.Impact of the NotesThe Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2021. The standard eliminates the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature. See "Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements" for additional information.Until January 1, 2021, the Notes were separated into liability and equity components.•The initial carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring a similar debt instrument’s fair value that does not have an associated conversion feature. The excess of the Notes’ principal amount over the initial carrying amount of the liability component, the debt discount, was amortized as interest expense over the Notes’ contractual term.•The equity component was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital and not remeasured. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the book value of the Notes increased by $69.5 million to $587.7 million, and retained earnings increased by $9.4 million. The retained earnings adjustment reflects the tax effected difference between the value of the Notes and the embedded conversion feature before adoption and the combined convertible instrument's amortized cost after adoption.Carrying value of the Notes:(in thousands)June 30, 2021December 31, 2020Principal$600,000 $600,000 Unamortized debt discount— (71,222)Unamortized issuance costs(10,908)(10,575)Convertible senior notes, net$589,092 $518,203 Conversion options$— $84,120 Issuance costs— (2,037)Deferred taxes— (20,479)Additional paid-in capital$— $61,604 Interest expense related to the Notes:Three Months EndedJune 30,Six Months EndedJune 30,(in thousands)2021202020212020Contractual interest expense (0.75% coupon)$1,125 $1,125 $2,250 $1,575 Amortization of debt discount— 3,757 — 5,253 Amortization of issuance costs675 558 1,348 780 $1,800 $5,440 $3,598 $7,608 13PEGASYSTEMS INC.NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)The effective interest rate for the Notes:Six Months EndedJune 30,20212020Weighted-average effective interest rate1.2 %4.3 %Future payments of principal and contractual interest:June 30, 2021(in thousands)PrincipalInterestTotal2021$— $2,250 $2,250 2022— 4,500 4,500 2023— 4,500 4,500 2024— 4,500 4,500 2025600,000 1,488 601,488 $600,000 $17,238 $617,238 Capped call transactionsIn February 2020, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions cover approximately 4.4 million shares (representing the number of shares for which the Notes are initially convertible) of the Company’s common stock. The Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce common stock dilution and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company must make, other than for principal and interest, upon conversion of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap of $196.44. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including mergers and tender offers.The Capped Call Transactions are accounted for as derivative instruments and do not qualify for the Company’s own equity scope exception in ASC 815 since, in some cases of early settlement, the settlement value of the Capped Call Transactions, calculated in accordance with the governing documents, may not represent a fair value measurement. The Capped Call Transactions are classified as other long-term assets and remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period, resulting in a non-operating gain or loss.Change in capped call transactions:Six Months EndedJune 30,(in thousands)20212020January 1,$83,597 $— Issuance— 51,900 Fair value adjustment7,192 827 June 30,$90,789 $52,727 Credit facilityIn November 2019, and as amended as of February 2020, July 2020, and September 2020, the Company entered into a five-year $100 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with PNC Bank, National Association. The Company may use borrowings to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Subject to specific conditions, the Credit Facility allows the Company to increase the aggregate commitment to $200 million. The commitments expire on November 4, 2024, and any outstanding loans will be payable on such date. The Credit Facility, as amended, contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, those relating to additional indebtedness, liens, asset divestitures, and affiliate transactions. The Company is also required to comply with financial covenants, including:•Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020 and ending with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021, at least $200 million in cash and investments held by Pegasystems Inc.•Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2022, a maximum net consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0 (with a step-up in the event of certain acquisitions) and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0.As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.14PEGASYSTEMS INC.NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basisThe Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, Capped Call Transactions, and venture investments at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for classifying the fair value measurements, a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies the fair value measurements based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, was established as follows: •Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and •Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and minimize unobservable inputs when determining fair value.The fair value of the Capped Call Transactions at the end of each reporting period is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield. The Company applies judgment when determining expected volatility. The Company considers both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security. The Company’s venture investments are recorded at fair value based on valuation methods, including observable public companies and transaction prices and unobservable inputs, including the volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities the Company holds.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:June 30, 2021December 31, 2020(in thousands)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash equivalents$4,650 $— $— $4,650 $42,339 $14,000 $— $56,339 Marketable securities $— $271,459 $— $271,459 $— $293,269 $— $293,269 Capped Call Transactions (1)$— $90,789 $— $90,789 $— $83,597 $— $83,597 Venture investments (1) (2)$— $— $9,779 $9,779 $— $— $8,345 $8,345 (1) Included in other long-term assets.

The fair value was determined based on the Notes’ quoted price in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce common stock dilution and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company must make, other than for principal and interest, upon conversion of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap of $196.44. The Capped Call Transactions are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, in all periods as their effect would be anti-dilutive.(4) Outstanding stock options and RSUs that were anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method in the period were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share. These awards may be dilutive in the future.NOTE 14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTSOn July 6, 2021, the Company entered into an office space lease (the “Lease”) for 131 thousand square feet in Waltham, Massachusetts. The lease term of approximately 11 years is expected to commence on August 1, 2021 (the “Lease Commencement Date”), subject to certain adjustments for the initial occupancy date. The annual rent equals the base rent plus the Company’s portion of building operating costs and real estate taxes for the year. Rent first becomes payable on August 1, 2022, subject to adjustment based on the Lease Commencement Date. Base rent for the first year is $6 million and will increase by 3% annually. In addition, the Company will receive an improvement allowance from the landlord of $11.8 million.18ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Quarterly Report”) contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, will, could, should, estimates, may, targets, strategies, projects, forecasts, guidance, likely, and usually, or variations of such words and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations and assumptions.Forward-looking statements deal with future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to:•our future financial performance and business plans; •the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources;•the continued payment of our quarterly dividends;•the timing of revenue recognition; •management of our transition to a more subscription-based business model;•variation in demand for our products and services, including among clients in the public sector;•the impact of actual or threatened public health emergencies, such as the Coronavirus (“COVID-19”);•reliance on third-party service providers;•compliance with our debt obligations and covenants;•the potential impact of our convertible senior notes and Capped Call Transactions;•reliance on key personnel;•the relocation of our corporate headquarters;•the continued uncertainties in the global economy;•foreign currency exchange rates;•the potential legal and financial liabilities and reputation damage due to cyber-attacks;•security breaches and security flaws;•our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and costs associated with defending such rights;•our client retention rate; and•management of our growth.These risks and others that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements are described further in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and other filings we make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

We deliver applications tailored to our clients’ specific industry needs.19Cloud TransitionWe are in the process of transitioning our business to sell software primarily through subscription arrangements, particularly Pega Cloud. Until we substantially complete our Cloud Transition, which we anticipate will occur in 2023, we may experience lower revenue growth and lower operating cash flow growth or negative cash flow. Operating performance and the actual mix of revenue and new arrangements in a given period can fluctuate based on client preferences for our perpetual and subscription offerings. See the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information.Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)As of June 30, 2021, COVID-19 has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. See “Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)” in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information.Performance metricsWe utilize performance metrics to analyze and assess our overall performance, make operating decisions, and forecast and plan for future periods, including:Annual contract value (“ACV”) | Increased 22% since June 30, 2020•ACV, as reported, represents the annualized value of our active contracts as of the measurement date. The contract's total value is divided by its duration in years to calculate ACV for term license and Pega Cloud contracts. Maintenance revenue for the quarter then ended is multiplied by four to calculate ACV for maintenance. Client Cloud ACV is composed of maintenance ACV and term license ACV. ACV is a performance measure that we believe provides useful information to our management and investors, particularly during our Cloud Transition.* Foreign currency exchange rate changes contributed 3-4% to total ACV growth in 2021.20Remaining performance obligations (“Backlog”) | Increased 26% since June 30, 2020•Backlog represents expected future revenue on existing non-cancellable contracts.Year to date Pega Cloud revenue | Increased 53% since the six months ended June 30, 2020•Pega Cloud revenue is revenue under U.S. GAAP for cloud contracts.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared following accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future given the available information.For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, we encourage you to read the discussion in the following locations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020:•“Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgments” in Item 7; and •“Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8.21There have been no significant changes other than those disclosed in “Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements” in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenueCloud TransitionWe are in the process of transitioning our business to sell software primarily through subscription arrangements, particularly Pega Cloud. Revenue growth has been slower because of this transition. Revenue from Pega Cloud and maintenance arrangements is typically recognized over the contract term. In contrast, revenue from license sales is recognized when the license rights become effective, typically upfront.(Dollars in thousands)Three Months EndedJune 30,ChangeSix Months EndedJune 30,Change2021202020212020Pega Cloud$73,293 23 %$48,838 21 %$24,455 50 %$141,151 22 %$92,304 19 %$48,847 53 %Client Cloud$183,078 56 %$116,488 52 %$66,590 57 %$370,148 58 %$280,440 57 %$89,708 32 %Maintenance78,782 24 %72,222 33 %6,560 9 %154,343 24 %145,917 30 %8,426 6 %Term license104,296 32 %44,266 19 %60,030 136 %215,805 34 %134,523 27 %81,282 60 %Subscription (1)$256,371 79 %$165,326 73 %91,045 55 %511,299 80 %372,744 76 %138,555 37 %Perpetual license12,596 4 %9,057 4 %3,539 39 %18,048 3 %12,716 3 %5,332 42 %Consulting56,735 17 %52,992 23 %3,743 7 %109,854 17 %107,506 21 %2,348 2 %$325,702 100 %$227,375 100 %$98,327 43 %$639,201 100 %$492,966 100 %$146,235 30 %(1) Reflects client arrangements subject to renewal (Pega Cloud, maintenance, and term license).The total revenue changes in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 generally reflect our Cloud Transition. Other factors impacting our revenue include:•An increasing portion of our term license contracts include multi-year committed maintenance periods instead of annually renewable maintenance. Under multi-year committed maintenance arrangements, a larger portion of the total contract value is recognized as maintenance revenue over the contract term rather than as term license revenue upon the effectiveness of the license rights. In the three months ended June 30, 2021, multi-year committed maintenance contributed $4.3 million to maintenance revenue growth and reduced term revenue growth by $15.4 million. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, multi-year committed maintenance contributed $7.8 million to maintenance revenue growth and reduced term revenue growth by $20.9 million.•Maintenance renewal rates of higher than 90%.•The increases in term license revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were driven by a large, existing customer that expanded their use of our software, renewed an existing multi-year contract, and extended the term of the agreement earlier in the year than anticipated.•The increases in perpetual license revenue were primarily due to several large perpetual license contracts recognized in revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021.•The increases in consulting revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to increases in billable hours. As part of our long-term strategy, we intend to continue growing and leveraging our ecosystem of partners on implementation projects, potentially reducing our future consulting revenue growth.Gross profitThree Months EndedJune 30,ChangeSix Months EndedJune 30,Change(Dollars in thousands)2021202020212020Software license$116,236 99 %$52,344 98 %$63,892 122 %$232,547 99 %$145,576 99 %$86,971 60 %Maintenance73,787 94 %66,631 92 %7,156 11 %143,562 93 %134,750 92 %8,812 7 %Pega Cloud49,242 67 %29,850 61 %19,392 65 %94,543 67 %55,783 60 %38,760 69 %Consulting1,906 3 %1,859 4 %47 3 %1,571 1 %638 1 %933 146 %$241,171 74 %$150,684 66 %$90,487 60 %$472,223 74 %$336,747 68 %$135,476 40 %•The changes in gross profit in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to our Cloud Transition, revenue growth, and cost-efficiency gains as Pega Cloud grows and scales.22Operating expenses(Dollars in thousands)Three Months EndedJune 30,ChangeSix Months EndedJune 30,Change2021202020212020% of Revenue% of Revenue% of Revenue% of RevenueSelling and marketing$156,423 48 %$127,607 56 %$28,816 23 %$305,162 48 %$263,631 53 %$41,531 16 %Research and development$64,395 20 %$58,869 26 %$5,526 9 %$126,837 20 %$117,596 24 %$9,241 8 %General and administrative$19,161 6 %$15,655 7 %$3,506 22 %$37,431 6 %$31,285 6 %$6,146 20 %•The increases in selling and marketing in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $22.6 million and $48.0 million, attributable to increases in headcount and equity compensation. The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to deepen relationships with existing clients and target new accounts.•The increases in research and development in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $7.2 million and $11.8 million, attributable to increases in headcount and equity compensation.•The increases in general and administrative in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $2.2 million and $3.5 million, attributable to increases in headcount and equity compensation, and increases in professional services fees of $1.8 million and $3.4 million.•In February 2021, we agreed to accelerate our exit from our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters to October 1, 2021, in exchange for a one-time payment from our landlord of $18 million. This agreement was the primary contributor to decreases in facilities expenses of $2.1 million and $3.3 million in selling and marketing, $2.4 million and $3.6 million in research and development, and $1.1 million and $1.6 million in general and administrative, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021.Other income (expense), net(Dollars in thousands)Three Months EndedJune 30,ChangeSix Months EndedJune 30,Change2021202020212020Foreign currency transaction (loss) gain$(403)$4,256 $(4,659)*$(5,501)$(1,691)$(3,810)(225)%Interest income236 242 (6)(2)%389 849 (460)(54)%Interest expense(1,959)(5,529)3,570 65 %(3,839)(7,835)3,996 51 %Gain on capped call transactions26,309 19,419 6,890 35 %7,192 827 6,365 770 %Other income, net— — — *106 1,374 (1,268)(92)%$24,183 $18,388 $5,795 32 %$(1,653)$(6,476)$4,823 74 %* not meaningful•The changes in foreign currency transaction (loss) gain in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with our foreign currency-denominated cash, receivables, and intercompany balances held by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom.•The decreases in interest income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to declines in market interest rates.•The decreases in interest expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily due to our adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021.

The most significant discrete items were excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the impact of changes in statutory tax rates applicable to our U.K.-based deferred tax assets.Stock-based compensation increases the variability of our effective tax rates. The impact of stock-based compensation on a given period depends on our profitability, the attributes of our stock compensation awards we grant, and award holders' exercise behavior.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESSix Months EndedJune 30, (in thousands)20212020Cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$19,410 $(21,199)Investing activities10,493 (19,404)Financing activities(60,717)485,293 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(1,207)(942)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(32,021)$443,748 (in thousands)June 30, 2021December 31, 2020Held by U.S. entities$306,754 $399,138 Held by foreign entities104,583 66,030 Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$411,337 $465,168 We believe that our current cash, cash flow from operations, and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations, stock repurchases, and quarterly cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our future growth, operating results, and the investments required to support our operations. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business, we may seek to finance our operations from available funds or additional external financing.If it becomes necessary to repatriate foreign funds, we may be required to pay U.S. and foreign taxes upon repatriation. Due to the complexity of income tax laws and regulations, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of taxes we would have to pay.Operating activitiesWe are in the process of transitioning our business to sell software primarily through subscription arrangements, particularly Pega Cloud. This transition has impacted and is expected to continue to impact the timing of our billings and cash collections. Pega Cloud, term license, and maintenance arrangements are generally billed and collected over the contract term, while perpetual license arrangements are generally billed and collected upfront when the license rights become effective. As client preferences shift in favor of Pega Cloud arrangements, we could experience slower operating cash flow growth, or negative cash flow, in the near term.The change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to a significant increase in client collections.Corporate headquartersIn February 2021, we agreed to accelerate our exit from our existing Cambridge, Massachusetts corporate headquarters to October 1, 2021, in exchange for a one-time payment from our landlord of $18 million, which is expected to be paid in the last quarter of 2021. The accelerated exit from this lease reduced our future lease liabilities by $21.1 million. On March 31, 2021 we leased office space at One Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, to serve as our future corporate headquarters. The approximately 4.5 year lease includes base rent of approximately $2 million per year.New Waltham OfficeOn July 6, 2021, we entered into an office space lease (the “Lease”) for 131 thousand square feet in Waltham, Massachusetts. The lease term of approximately 11 years is expected to commence on August 1, 2021 (the “Lease Commencement Date”), subject to certain adjustments for the initial occupancy date. The annual rent equals the base rent plus our portion of building operating costs and real estate taxes. Rent first becomes payable on August 1, 2022, subject to adjustment based on the Lease Commencement Date. Base rent for the first year is $6 million and will increase by 3% annually. In addition, we will receive an improvement allowance from the landlord of $11.8 million.24Investing activitiesThe change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily driven by investments in financial instruments, an acquisition, and a decrease in office space related capital expenditures.Financing activitiesIn February 2020, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due March 1, 2025. In November 2019, and as amended as of February 2020, July 2020, and September 2020, we entered into a five-year $100 million senior secured revolving credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association. As of June 30, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. See "Note 8.

However, our international sales are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offsets our foreign currency exposure.

We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity. A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the British pound exchange rate in comparison to the Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar would have resulted in the following impact:Six Months EndedJune 30,(in thousands)20212020Foreign currency gain (loss)$(5,676)$8,932 ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) as of June 30, 2021. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2021.(b) Changes in internal control over financial reportingThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.26PART II - OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSWe encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
