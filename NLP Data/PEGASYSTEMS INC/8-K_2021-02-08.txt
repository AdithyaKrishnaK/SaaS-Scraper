Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory                     Arrangements of Certain Officers(e)    On February 2, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Pegasystems Inc. (the “Company”) approved the 2021 Section 16 Officer/FLT Member Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) for the executive officers of the Company (the “Executive Officers”). The Incentive Plan covers the period from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (the “Incentive Period”). The Incentive Plan is designed to establish a pool of funds to be available for making bonus payments to the Executive Officers if the Company achieves certain performance goals (the “Corporate Goals”) during the Incentive Period. For purposes of the Incentive Plan, the Corporate Goals consist of financial goals weighted at 75% and strategic goals weighted at 25%.  The percentage achievement of the Corporate Goals (the “Funding Percentage”) determines the extent to which the Incentive Plan is funded, except that if the Funding Percentage is less than 70% then the Incentive Plan will not be funded at all.  If the Funding Percentage is greater than 100%, the Company may fund an enhanced incentive as determined by the Board in its discretion. Once the Funding Percentage has been determined, the actual incentive payment for each Executive Officer is conditioned on his or her continued active employment with the Company and may be adjusted based on their individual performance.               The Company permits each Executive Officer to elect to receive a portion of his or her 2021 bonus equal to 50% of his or her target Incentive Plan payment in the form of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) instead of in cash. For this purpose, RSUs will be calculated based upon 85% of their fair market value on the grant date. If elected, the equity grant will occur during the open trading period following the public release of the Company’s 2020 financial results and is subject to vest 100% on or about the Incentive Plan payout date in 2022 for all participants. Vesting is conditioned upon threshold funding of the Incentive Plan and, with respect to each Executive Officer, on his or her continued active employment with the Company and their individual performance. If these conditions are not met, the equity grant cannot be exercised by the Executive Officer and will expire. The foregoing summary description of the Incentive Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
