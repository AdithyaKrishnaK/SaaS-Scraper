If the Company’s TSR over the Performance Period is at the 60th percentile when ranked against the TSRs of the companies in the Index Group, 100 percent of the target number of shares will be eligible to vest. For every percentile by which the Company’s TSR ranking within the Index Group exceeds the 60th percentile, the number of shares eligible to vest will increase by 2 22/39 percent of target, up to a maximum payout of 200 percent of target if the Company’s TSR ranking is at the 99th percentile. For every percentile by which the Company’s TSR ranking within the Index Group is below the 60th percentile, the number of shares eligible to vest will decrease by 3 1/3 percent of target, with no payout if the Company’s TSR ranking is below the 30th percentile. Additionally, if the Company’s absolute TSR over the Performance Period is negative, in no event will the number of shares eligible to vest exceed 100 percent of the target amount, even if the Company’s TSR ranks above the 60th percentile within the Index Group. Special vesting rules apply in the event of a change of control.SignaturePursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. Dated: March 26, 2021salesforce.com, inc./s/ TODD MACHTMESTodd MachtmesExecutive Vice President and General Counsel
