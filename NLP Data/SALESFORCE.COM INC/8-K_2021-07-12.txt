Item 1.01
 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  On July 12, 2021, salesforce.com, inc. (“Salesforce” or the “Company”) completed its previously announced registered public offering (the “Offering”) of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.500% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “Sustainability Notes”), $1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.950% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”), $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.700% Senior Notes due 2041 (the “2041 Notes”), $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.900% Senior Notes due 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.050% Senior Notes due 2061 (the “2061 Notes” and, together with the 2024 Notes, the 2031 Notes, the 2041 Notes and the 2051 Notes, the “Mandatorily Redeemable Notes”; the Mandatorily Redeemable Notes and the Sustainability Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Notes”), and in connection therewith executed the Second Supplemental Indenture (the “Second Supplemental Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will be governed by that certain Indenture, dated as of April 11, 2018 (the “Base Indenture”), between the Company and the Trustee, as amended and supplemented with respect to the Notes by the Second Supplemental Indenture (the Base Indenture as so amended and supplemented, the “Indenture”).  The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-251123), including a preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 29, 2021 to the prospectus contained therein dated December 4, 2020, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and a free writing prospectus dated June 29, 2021, filed by the Company with the SEC, pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act.  The 2024 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 0.625% per year and mature on July 15, 2024. The Sustainability Notes will bear interest at the rate of 1.500% per year and mature on July 15, 2028. The 2031 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 1.950% per year and mature on July 15, 2031. The 2041 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 2.700% per year and mature on July 15, 2041. The 2051 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 2.900% per year and mature on July 15, 2051. The 2061 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 3.050% per year and mature on July 15, 2061.  Interest on the Notes will accrue from July 12, 2021, and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2022.  The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes of each series at the applicable redemption price, as described in the Second Supplemental Indenture.  The Notes are the Company’s unsecured, unsubordinated debt obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations from time to time outstanding.  On December 1, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, supplemented, restated or modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Skyline Strategies I Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Skyline Strategies II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Slack Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Slack”). The acquisition of Slack by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement is referred to in this Form 8-K as the “proposed transaction.” The Company intends (i) to use the net proceeds of the Offering of the Mandatorily Redeemable Notes to partially fund the cash consideration payable by the Company for the proposed transaction and to pay related fees, costs and expenses and (ii) to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the Sustainability Notes to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, one or more new or existing green or social projects that satisfy certain criteria. If the consummation of the proposed transaction does not occur on or before June 1, 2022 or the Company notifies the Trustee that it will not pursue the consummation of the proposed transaction, the Company will be required to redeem the Mandatorily Redeemable Notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Mandatorily Redeemable Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”). The Sustainability Notes are not subject to the Special Mandatory Redemption.  The Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the Notes, including failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Events of default under the Indenture arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency will automatically cause the acceleration of the amounts due under the Notes. If any other event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing with respect to a series of Notes, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series may declare the acceleration of the amounts due under the applicable Notes.  The foregoing descriptions of the Notes, the Base Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture, which is included as Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K, the Second Supplemental Indenture, which is included as Exhibit 4.2 to this Form 8-K, and the forms of Notes, which are included as Exhibits 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 to this Form 8-K, and each of which is incorporated into this Form 8-K.
