Subject to Compensation Committee approval, the Company also intends to grant Mr. Taylor $3,000,000 of performance stock units and options to purchase $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price equal to the per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which are expected to be subject to the Company’s standard vesting provisions.
