(the “Company”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Topos Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and NIC Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NIC”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into NIC (the “Merger”), with NIC surviving the Merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, par value $0.0001 per share, of NIC (the “NIC Common Stock”) other than (i) shares of NIC Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by the Company, NIC or any of their respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, including shares of NIC held as treasury stock, (ii) shares of NIC Common Stock as to which dissenters’ rights have been properly perfected, and (iii) shares of NIC Common Stock covered by unvested NIC restricted stock awards) will be converted in the Merger into the right to receive $34.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the completion of the Merger is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including, among others: (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of NIC Common Stock; (ii) the accuracy of the parties’ respective representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, subject to specified materiality qualifications; (iii) compliance by the parties with their respective covenants in the Merger Agreement in all material respects; (iv) the absence of any order restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; and (v) the expiration of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.The Merger Consideration is expected to be financed with a combination of new debt and cash on the Company’s balance sheet. In connection with its entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company obtained a commitment from Goldman Sachs Bank USA for a $1.6 billion 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility, subject to customary conditions.The Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby have been unanimously approved by the NIC board of directors, and the NIC board of directors has resolved to recommend to the stockholders of NIC to adopt the Merger Agreement, subject to its terms and conditions.The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, with respect to NIC restricted stock awards, (i) each vested restricted stock award will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of NIC Common Stock subject to such awards, less applicable withholding of taxes and other authorized deductions, (ii) each outstanding unvested performance-based restricted stock award will automatically vest in full, in accordance with the terms of its award agreement, and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such number of shares of NIC Common Stock, less applicable withholding of taxes and other authorized deductions, and (iii) each outstanding unvested time-based restricted stock will be assumed by the Company and converted into corresponding awards relating to the Company’s Common Stock in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by each of the Company, Merger Sub, and NIC, including, among others, covenants by NIC regarding the conduct of its business during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, public disclosures and other matters. NIC is required, among other things, not to solicit alternative business combination transactions and, subject to certain exceptions, not to engage in discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative business combination transaction.Both the Company and NIC may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, including (i) if the Merger is not consummated by June 30, 2021, subject to an extension of up to three months in order to obtain required regulatory approval, (ii) if the approval of the NIC stockholders is not obtained, and (iii) if NIC’s board makes an adverse recommendation change with respect to the proposed transaction or approve or recommend a superior acquisition proposal. In certain circumstances in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, including if NIC’s board of directors changes or withdraws its recommendation of the Merger to its stockholders, fails to include its recommendation to shareholders in NIC’s proxy statement, or terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a “superior proposal,” NIC will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $55 million in cash.The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, Merger Sub, or NIC. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure letters provided by each of the Company and NIC to each other in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement or in filings of the parties with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. These confidential disclosure letters contain information that modifies, qualifies, and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties and certain covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purposes of allocating risk between the Company and NIC rather than establishing matters of fact. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement should not be relied on as characterization of the actual state of facts about the Company, Merger Sub, or NIC.Item 7.01    Regulation FD Disclosures    On February 10, 2021, Tyler Technologies, Inc.
