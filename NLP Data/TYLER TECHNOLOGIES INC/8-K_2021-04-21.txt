(the “Company”) of its previously announced acquisition of NIC Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NIC”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 9, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Topos Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and NIC, on April 21, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Merger Sub merged with and into NIC, with NIC surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”).  As result of the Merger, NIC became a direct subsidiary of the Company and NIC’s subsidiaries became indirect subsidiaries of the Company.Item 1.01    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.In connection with the completion of the Merger and on the Closing Date, the Company, as borrower, entered into a new $1,400,000,000 Credit Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) with the various lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender, and Issuing Lender.  The New Credit Agreement provides for (1) a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500,000,000, including subfacilities for standby letters of credit and swingline loans, each in a maximum amount to be mutually determined and on customary terms and conditions (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (2) an amortizing five-year term A-1 loan in the aggregate amount of $600,000,000 (the “Term A-1 Loan”), and (3) a non-amortizing three-year term A-2 loan in the aggregate amount of $300,000,000 (the “Term A-2 Loan” and, together with the Term A-1 Loan, the “Term Loans”),.  The New Credit Agreement matures on April 21, 2026, and loans may be prepaid at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to certain minimum amounts and payment of any LIBOR breakage costs.  In addition to the required amortization payments on the Term A-1 Loan of 5% quarterly, certain mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Facility will be required (i) upon the issuance or incurrence of additional debt not otherwise permitted under the New Credit Agreement and (ii) upon the occurrence of certain asset sales and insurance and condemnation recoveries, subject to certain thresholds, baskets, and reinvestment provisions as provided in the New Credit Agreement.   The New Credit Agreement replaces and terminates the Company’s existing $400,000,000 credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement dated as of September 30, 2019 (the “2019 Credit Agreement”).  The Company’s previously announced commitment from Goldman Sachs Bank USA for a $1.6 billion 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility also terminated on the Closing Date.The Revolving Credit Facility will be available on a revolving basis until the maturity date, provided that, the aggregate amount of all loans under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Closing Date in connection with the Merger and related transactions shall not exceed $250,000,000.  The New Credit Agreement includes a mechanism by which the Company may request an incremental loan facility in the form of incremental term loans or an increase in the revolving credit facility.  Each of the Term Loans was drawn in full on the Closing Date. The New Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of defaults.  The New Credit Agreement is unsecured and requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions, prohibits the Company from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends, or loans, and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens.  The Company’s obligations under the New Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by its direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries.The Term Loans and a portion of the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility, in the amount of $250,000,000, together with cash available to the Company, including the proceeds of the Company’s offering in March 2021 of its 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, have been used to complete the Merger (see Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K), repay any indebtedness under the 2019 Credit Agreement, and pay fees and expenses in connection with the Merger and the New Credit Agreement.  The remaining portion of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for working capital requirements, acquisitions, and capital expenditures of the Company and its subsidiaries.     Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term A-1 Loans will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate of either (1) the Administrative Agent’s prime commercial lending rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) (the “Base Rate”) plus a margin of 0.125% to 0.75% or (2) the one-,  three-,  six-, or, subject to approval by all lenders, twelve-month LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.75%.  Term A-2 Loans will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate of either (1) the Base Rate plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.50% or (2) the one-,  three-, or six- or, subject to approval by all lenders, twelve-month LIBOR rate plus a margin of 0.875% to 1.50%.  The margin in each case is based upon the Company’s total net leverage ratio, as determined pursuant to the New Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement has customary benchmark replacement language with respect to the replacement of LIBOR once LIBOR becomes unavailable.  In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal of loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee, initially 0.25% per annum, ranging from 0.15% to 0.30% based upon the Company’s total net leverage ratio.The foregoing is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the New Credit Agreement and not a complete description of the New Credit Agreement.

The “Restricted Stock Conversion Ratio” means the quotient, rounded (with simple rounding) to the fourth decimal place, obtained by dividing (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the volume weighted average closing sale price of one share of Company Common Stock as reported on the NYSE for the ten consecutive trading days ending on April 20, 2021, the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.In connection with the Merger, the Company paid approximately $2.3 billion in cash as the aggregate Merger Consideration.The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 10, 2021 and is incorporated by reference herein.Item 7.01    Regulation FD Disclosures.On April 21, 2021, the Company and NIC issued a joint press release announcing the completion of the Merger.As provided in General Instruction B.2. to Form 8-K, the information set forth in this Item 7.01 and Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall they be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.     Item 9.01    Financial Statements and Exhibits.(a)    Financial statements of businesses or funds acquired.The audited consolidated balance sheets of NIC as December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the audited consolidated statements of income, statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, and statements of cash flows of NIC for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the notes related thereto, are incorporated by reference to NIC’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021.(b)    Pro forma financial information.The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information reflecting the Merger, including the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as December 31, 2020, and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020, are filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.(d)    Exhibits.EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit numberExhibit description10.1Credit Agreement, dated as of April 21, 2021, by and among Tyler Technologies, Inc., as Borrower, the Lenders referred to therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender, and Issuing Lender, PNC Bank, National Association and Truist Bank, as Co-Syndication Agents,  Citizens Bank, N.A., and Regions Bank, as Co-Documentation Agents, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, PNC Capital Markets LLC, and Truist Securities, Inc. as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners.23.1Consent of Ernst & Young LLP.99.1Joint Press Release of Tyler Technologies, Inc. and NIC Inc. dated April 21, 2021.99.2Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information as of December 31, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020.104Cover Page Interactive Data File (embedded in the Inline XBRL document)     SIGNATURESPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.TYLER TECHNOLOGIES, INC./s/ Brian K.
