Exhibit 3.1 
AMENDED AND RESTATED 
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
OF  UNITY SOFTWARE INC.
 Unity Software Inc. (the Corporation), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of
the State of Delaware, hereby certifies as follows:  A. The Corporation was incorporated in Delaware pursuant to a Certificate of
Incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 28, 2009.  B. This Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
DGCL), and has been duly approved by the written consent of the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL. 
C. The certificate of incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows: 
I.  The name of the
Corporation is Unity Software Inc.  II. 
The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is 251 Little Falls Drive, City of Wilmington, 19808, County
of New Castle, and the name of the registered agent of the Corporation in the State of Delaware at such address is Corporation Service Company. 
III.  The purpose of the
Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the DGCL.  IV. 
A. The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, Common Stock and
Preferred Stock. The total number of shares which the Corporation is authorized to issue is 1,100,000,000 shares. 1,000,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, having a par value per share of $0.000005. 100,000,000 shares
shall be Preferred Stock, having a par value per share of $0.000005.  B. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or
more series. The board of directors of the Corporation (the Board of Directors) is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any of the shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix
the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such

  1 





qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares
and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such
series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution
originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, irrespective of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL,
unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock. 
C. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders
of the Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any
certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together
as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred
Stock).  V.  For the
management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may
be, it is further provided that:  A. Management of Business. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of
the Corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by resolutions adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors.  B. Board of Directors. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect
additional directors under specified circumstances, following the closing of the initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act), covering
the offer and sale of Common Stock to the public (the Initial Public Offering), the directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. The Board of
Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to such classes at the time the classification becomes effective. At the first annual meeting of stockholders following the closing of the Initial Public Offering,
the term of office of the Class I directors shall expire and Class I directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the second annual meeting of stockholders following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the term of
office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the third annual meeting of stockholders following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the term of office of
the Class III directors shall expire and Class III directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the
directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting. 
  2 




Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, each director shall serve until
his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 
C. Removal of Directors.  
1. Subject to the rights of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, following the closing
of the Initial Public Offering, neither the Board of Directors nor any individual director may be removed without cause.  2.
Subject to any limitation imposed by applicable law, any individual director or directors may be removed with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. 
D. Vacancies. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall, unless the Board
of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders and except as otherwise provided by applicable law, be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of
the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and until such directors successor shall have been elected and qualified. 
E. Bylaws Amendments. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.
Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the
Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such action by
stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding
shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. 
F. Stockholder Actions. 
1. The directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws so provide. 
2. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in accordance
with the Bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent or electronic transmission.  3. Advance notice of
stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. 
VI.  A. The liability of
the directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent under applicable law. 
  3 




B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation is authorized to
provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements
with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the
stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law as so amended.  C. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights
or protections or increase the liability of any director under this Article VI in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability or indemnification. 
VII.  A. Unless the
Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located
within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings
under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (B) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director,
officer or other employee of the Corporation, to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders; (C) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any action or proceeding to interpret,
apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation (including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (E) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers
jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (F) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation, governed by the internal
affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Section A of Article VII shall not apply to suits brought to
enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, or the 1933 Act. 
B. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal
district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the 1933 Act. 
C. Any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice
of and consented to the provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  VIII. 
A. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation. 
  4 




B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or any provision of applicable law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the capital stock of the Corporation required by law
or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.  * * * *

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been signed
on behalf of the Corporation by its duly authorized officer effective this 22nd day of September, 2020.
