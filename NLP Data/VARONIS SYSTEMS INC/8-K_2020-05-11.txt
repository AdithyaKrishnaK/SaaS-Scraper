(the “Company”) entered into a purchase agreement among the Company and the representatives of the several initial purchasers (the “Purchase Agreement”) relating to the sale of $253.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”), reflecting the exercise in full of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase an additional $33.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes were sold in a private offering only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering expenses, will be approximately $245.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include research and development, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Company also used approximately $29.3 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the aggregate cost of Capped Call Transactions into which it entered, as described below.Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.Indenture and NotesThe Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated May 11, 2020 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will mature on August 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.  Interest will be payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2020, at a rate of 1.25% per year.The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “common stock”), at the option of a holder, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five consecutive business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, as determined following a request by a holder of the Notes in the manner described in the Indenture, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events specified in the Indenture. In addition, regardless of the foregoing circumstances, on or after February 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its Notes at any time.The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 10.8556 shares of the Company’s common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $92.12 per share of the Company’s common stock). The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events (including customary anti-dilution scenarios, voluntary increases by the Company if determined to be in the Company’s best interest, subject to the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Exchange LLC, and voluntary adjustments by the Company to avoid or diminish income tax to holders of the Company’s common stock or rights to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock in connection with certain distributions, subject to the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Exchange LLC), but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the Notes’ maturity date or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such corporate event or convert its Notes called for redemption during the related redemption period, as the case may be, in certain circumstances, according to the stock price table set forth in the Indenture. Upon conversion, the Notes may be settled, at the Company’s election, in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock.The Notes will not be redeemable at the Company’s option prior to August 20, 2023. The Company may redeem the Notes for cash, at its option, on a redemption date occurring on or after August 20, 2023, and on or prior to the 41st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.If the Company undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.The Indenture includes customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the Notes may be due and payable immediately.The Notes are the Company’s unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s liabilities that are not so subordinated, effectively junior to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness the Company incurs in the future to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinate to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries.A copy of the Indenture and form of Note are filed as Exhibit 4.1 (with the form of Note included as Exhibit A thereto), to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing description of the Indenture and Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits.Capped Call TransactionsOn May 6, 2020, in connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the “Initial Capped Call Transactions”) with Bank of Montreal, Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (the “Option Counterparties”). In addition, in connection with initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional Notes, on May 8, 2020, the Company entered into additional capped call transactions (the “Additional Capped Call Transactions,” and, together with the Initial Capped Call Transactions, the “Capped Call Transactions”) with each of the Option Counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap initially equal to $141.72 (which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on May 6, 2020), subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Call Transactions, concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes, the Option Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may have entered or may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Notes at that time.In addition, the Option Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Notes, any repurchase of the Notes by the Company on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date, or any other date on which the Notes are retired by the Company, in each case, if the Company exercises its option to terminate the relevant portion of the Capped Call Transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Notes, which could affect holders’ ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock, if any, and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the Notes.The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by the Company with the Option Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the Notes, and will not affect any holder’s rights under the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions.A copy of the form of confirmation for the Capped Call Transactions is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing description of the terms of the Capped Call Transactions does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K under “Indenture and Notes” is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.Item 3.02 Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities.The information provided in this Current Report on Form 8-K under “Explanatory Note” and in Item 1.01 under “Indenture and Notes” is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.The Company’s offering of the Notes to the initial purchasers was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company relied on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the initial purchasers in the Purchase Agreement for the Notes, including that the initial purchasers would only offer, sell or deliver the Notes to persons whom they believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company sold the Notes to the initial purchasers at a discount of 2.75% of the offering price.The Notes and the shares of the Company’s common stock into which the Notes are convertible, if any, have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.Forward-Looking StatementsThis Current Report on Form 8-K contains “forward-looking” statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
