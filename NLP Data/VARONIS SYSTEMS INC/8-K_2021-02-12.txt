Item
1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On February 10, 2021, Varonis Systems, Inc.
(the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, Barclays Capital, Inc., Jefferies LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters
listed therein (the “Underwriters”), in connection with a public offering (the “Offering”), pursuant to
which the Company agreed to issue and sell 2,307,693 shares of common stock (the “Base Shares”), par value $0.001
per share (the “Common Stock”), plus up to an additional 346,153 shares (the "Optional Shares" and, together
with the Base Shares, the "Shares") pursuant to an option granted to the Underwriters, at a public offering price of
$195.00 per share. On February 11, 2021, the Underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase the Optional Shares.

and a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, which were previously filed with the SEC.
 
The
Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and customary conditions to
closing, obligations of the parties and termination provisions. Additionally, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to contribute to payments
the Underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.
